# Tetris

COLLABORATED WITH WONJAE LEE AND MINKYU CHOI

A tetris application using Qt C++. The application has 4 windows, which are all objects and inherit from QMainWindow. These windows are the main window, instructions, difficulty, and play. The main window simply has a logo and connections to the other windows. The instructions window has background music volume controls and a list of instructions to play the game. The difficulty window allows you to choose the difficulty of the actual tetris game in terms of the drop speed of blocks. The play window is where one goes to actually play the game. It is comprised of several objects that display the game board, the next piece, a play and pause button, score, and level.
